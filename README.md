Viruses are often made up of an RNA genome surrounded by a coat protein shell. The way RNA interacts with this protein shell is important for the virus’s stability and ability to infect cells. To fully understand these interactions, we need accurate maps of RNA atoms inside the protein shell. While cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has enabled us to capture high-resolution electron density maps of RNA, the challenge remains in reliably reconstructing RNA backbones and atomic coordinates from these maps. 

Current tools often rely on protein-focused modeling tools or require prior knowledge of atomic coordinates, limiting their applicability to RNA-specific problems. This project seeks to address that gap by developing a neural network-based approach that predicts RNA structure directly from cryo-EM density maps.
The central research question is: Can a neural network trained on paired RNA PDB (structural coordinates) and MRC (density maps) files generalize well enough to predict RNA structures using only an MRC file as its input during inference?

This research is significant because it leverages machine learning to reduce dependence on labeled or template-based methods. By training on paired datasets, the model learns mappings between 3D density distributions and underlying atomic structures. At inference, the system operates in a data-driven manner, using only an MRC file and the sequence data to reconstruct the RNA backbone.
This project differentiates itself from existing work by focusing on RNA (rather than protein) and by designing an inference pipeline that removes the need for labelled data. 

The expected outcomes are: a trained neural network capable of mapping density volumes to structural coordinates and an inference framework that predicts RNA structure from density maps alone. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute a novel computational approach that bridges experimental cryo-EM data with automated RNA modeling.

The file hpc_analysis.py is designed to build a neural network and train it on multiple pairs of PDB and MRC files. I named it hpc since I run these .py files on my university's computing cluster. The file inference.py then uses the trained model from hpc_analysis.py to take an input MRC file and predict its corresponding structure. Both scripts are still in preliminary stages, and I am actively working on improving them. Since I have been developing them on my local machine, there is currently not much of a commit history reflected in this repository.

The commented-out code reflects an earlier approach I tried. I kept it in place so I can easily revert to it if my current approach doesn’t work as intended.
